# Text 101 (Chinese version)

## Welcome to Text 101!
Hello everyone, this is my first repository and my first Unity game project. I have been following this Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/ by Ben Tristem. Sincere thanks to their help.

I decided to use GitHub to follow my progress with code learning and asking advices from this community.

## What is Text 101?
Text 101 is basically a text based escape game. You are awake in a cell and need to get out of here. It's based on Unity and wrote with MonoDevelop in C#.

It is still incomplete but totally playable. You could now follow through the storyline when you fetch the key and get out of the cell. 

## TO-DO
- A new HP system to count for mistakes players made
- Condense code with certain status value
- More comments that react to the actions of the player
- English version
